// here's the idea
// this has a dashboard to create the new Users, 
// list the Users

// Under each listed user, onclick(select) on them will lead you to a new window
// that window is for you to Delete User or Edit User or Login as User

// This is for the spawned new Chat window for a particular user
// If Login as User, provide a list of all the available chats for user in a new Chat window
// the window has a side bar that has the other chats aswell as the current chat being viewed
// in this chat window, you can send messages delete messages, and edit messages
